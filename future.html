            I'm super excited to be apart of gSchool and the G11 cohort!  I already know it will be a great 6 months and I can't wait to get to know everyone!

            After school I think the next, most logical, step will be to continue my training to become a Jedi.  It won't be an easy task, but I have been very blessed and fortunate to have been given the ability to use the Force.  You can see my progress with my abilities in the .gif below.

            Having a strong background in accounting and finance, I would like to hopefully use that knowledge to work for a fintech company around Denver.  Additionally, I've worked at several large companies, but I think I would be much better suited at a smaller startup company.
